# -NIFTY-50-Prediction
Nifty 50 Forecast.This project leverages 20 years of historical Nifty 50 data to forecast market trends using deep learning. Two powerful recurrent neural network architectures ‚Äî Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) ‚Äî were implemented to model time-series price behavior.

To enhance signal accuracy and trend detection, we integrated Exponential Moving Averages (EMA-50 and EMA-100) as technical indicators alongside raw price data.

üîç Highlights:
‚úÖ Dataset: 20 years of Nifty 50 daily data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

üß† Models: LSTM and GRU for sequential forecasting

üìä Indicators: EMA-50 and EMA-100 for trend smoothing

‚ö° Results: GRU achieved faster convergence; LSTM showed better long-term prediction accuracy

This project showcases the potential of deep learning in financial forecasting, combining traditional technical analysis with modern AI techniques.


üìà Exploratory Data Analysis


Close Price with MA50 & MA100

A bar chart showing the average annual closing price of Nifty 50 from 2010 to 2023. The steady upward trend reflects long-term market growth.

üß† Models and Predictions
GRU Model Predictions

This chart compares actual closing prices (blue) with GRU-predicted values for training (red) and test (green) datasets. The model closely follows real price movements, showing good predictive accuracy.

LSTM Model Predictions

The LSTM model‚Äôs predictions (orange for forecast, red for training) also align closely with actual prices. It captures long-term dependencies and provides smoother forecasts than GRU.

üìâ Training and Validation Loss
