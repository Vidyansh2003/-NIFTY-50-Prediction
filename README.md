# -NIFTY-50-Prediction
Nifty 50 Forecast.This project leverages 20 years of historical Nifty 50 data to forecast market trends using deep learning. Two powerful recurrent neural network architectures — Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) — were implemented to model time-series price behavior.

To enhance signal accuracy and trend detection, we integrated Exponential Moving Averages (EMA-50 and EMA-100) as technical indicators alongside raw price data.

🔍 Highlights:
✅ Dataset: 20 years of Nifty 50 daily data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

🧠 Models: LSTM and GRU for sequential forecasting

📊 Indicators: EMA-50 and EMA-100 for trend smoothing

⚡ Results: GRU achieved faster convergence; LSTM showed better long-term prediction accuracy

This project showcases the potential of deep learning in financial forecasting, combining traditional technical analysis with modern AI techniques.
